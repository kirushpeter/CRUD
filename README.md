# CRUD

 building a minimal web application using Flask. 
 We'll use SQLAlchemy in conjunction with SQLite to store information about books. 
 The application that we build here is not intended to be useful on its own. However, 
 once you can write a basic web application that takes user input and stores this in a database, 
 you are well on your way to writing any web application that you can imagine. We will therefore keep
 the example application as simple as possible,
 so that you can focus on the tools themselves instead of application-specific details.
